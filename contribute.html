<p>  <font size="48px">hello!</font> </p>
<b> if you would like to contribute to the site (or you know how to study for myth and history, unlike me), create a guide using the following questions: </b>
<p>
  </p>
  <ol>
<li>what is the ____?
<li> why should i take it?
<li>what if i don't want to study? 
<li>how much of a time commitment is this? i don't have that much time! 
<li>how much of a deal is a gold medal (nrce)/perfect score (national myth exam)/medal (medusa)?
<li>ok i'm convinced! are sign-ups closed yet? (only for medusa and nrce)
<li>is there a way to estimate my score? (based on practice test scores; real score is generally higher)
<li>i just got my estimated/real score back! is it above the gold/silver/bronze cutoff? (look up cutoffs on njcl.org and average the past 2-3 years)
<li>how do i study?
</ol>
<p> keep in mind that the stuff in parentheses are not the actual questions, but tips for the person writing the answers!

<font size="48px"> national latin exam! </font>
<p> <b> what is the nle? </b>
the national latin exam is a 40-question multiple choice exam that's offered in both paper and online format (idk which one Mrs. Masoni is going to use this year). each level takes a different nle, and the results are scored and returned within about a month to two months. (PRO TIP: COPY YOUR ANSWERS ONTO THE ANSWER SHEET-- YOU GET THAT BEFORE THE RESULTS COME BACK-- AND CHECK THEM ONCE THE ANSWER KEY IS UPLOADED!)
<p> <b> why should i take it? </b>
Mrs. Masoni forces you to take the nle, but it's still pretty easy to medal on and it's not that much of a time commitment.
<p> <b> what if i don't want to study? </b>
if you're generally "good" at latin grammar, you can probably get a gold medal without really studying (especially on intro and latin 1). the latin 2 exam is a bit harder, but it's definitely possible to get a good score without studying!
<p> <b> how do i get a perfect paper? </b>
ok so i don't really know what i'm doing but i've gotten a perfect score on both the nles i've taken, so this is how i studied:
<p> <b>   for the intro exam: </b> i didn't really study that much; i took the practice tests in Mrs. Masoni's packet and i went over a bit of geography. 
<p> <b>   for the latin 1 exam: </b> because there were a ton of geography questions, i printed out a map of the mediterranean region and labeled all the countries/seas (with what the romans called them e.g. france = gallia). for history/myth i went over some basic myth and i researched roman heroes (i ended up learning abt 4). i also did a ton of practice exams (17 i think) to familiarize myself with the questions and also bc there are a lot of repeats, especially in the earlier exams.
<p> <b>   if you want to get a perfect paper on the latin 2 exam: </b> i never actually took that one but it would definitely be helpful to go over the syllabus and maybe make a map of all the ancient geography. there's more history on the latin 2 exam too, so make sure to study that. for the reading comprehension, i would recommend doing a few practice tests to learn about the format and the kind of questions that we're tested on.
<p> <b> how much of a deal is a perfect paper? </b>
a perfect paper is a great accomplishment on higher levels of the exam, but it's still v good if you get one in sixth or seventh grade.
<p> <b> is there a way to estimate my score from my practice test scores? </b> 
if you want a gold, just aim to score in the 37-40 range consistently. you're going to have to get consistent 40s and master the material to be guaranteed a perfect (even then, there's the off chance of a weird question showing up). 

<p> <b> how do i study? </b>
refer to my section on how to get a perfect score and definitely do some of those things if you want to score well!

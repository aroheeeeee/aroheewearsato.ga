  <font size="48px"> national roman civilization exam!!</font> 
  <p> <b> what is the nrce? </b> the national roman civilization exam covers Roman history and culture from 753 BCE to Constantine</p>
  <p> <b> why should I take the nrce? </b> if you're good at/interested in history, you have a high chance of medaling on this one! (esp bc it's really hard for plebeians like me and most people do badly) </p>
  <p> <b> what if I don't want to study? </b> you might be able to get a bronze or silver (esp if you're in eighth grade) but it's really hard to get a high score without prior knowledge of the material. a bronze is still p impressive tho! </p>
  <p> <b> how much of a time commitment is this? </b> if you want to study, it could take anything from a few hours of cramming to a few years of interest! otherwise, it might take you 20-30 minutes during extra help on a tuesday.
  <p> <b> how big a deal is a gold medal? </b> last year, we only had one! (33/50 I think??) a gold medal is definitely an impressive achievement, mostly bc we don't learn that much history in class (especially in sixth and seventh grade) and there aren't a ton of people interested in history (I wonder why... ahahah jk) </p>
  <p> <b> ok, I'm convinced. are sign-ups closed yet? </b> I think so?? </a>.
  <p> <b> is there a way to estimate my score?
    </b> yep! take last year's exam; your score will generally be up to 10 points higher!! (I got an 18 on the practice exam and hopefully higher on the real thing??)

  <p> <b>I just got my estimated/real score back! is it above the gold/silver/bronze cutoff? </b> I don't know yet! njcl releases the official cutoffs based on the averages every year. 

  <p> <b> how do I study? </b> read Roman history??? put a textbook under your pillow and learn by diffusion?? listen to the history of Rome podcast??? evidently I'm a clueless plebeian, any history ppl pls send help ahahha

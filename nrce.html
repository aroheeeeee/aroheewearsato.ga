  <p> <b> What is the NRCE? </b> The National Roman Civilization Exam is a test on Roman history and culture from 753 BCE to Constantine</p>
  <p> <b> Why should I take the NRCE? </b> If you do well, you get a medal. If you don't do well, you took a test and and didn't meet a certain score threshold. Oh well. </p>
  <p> <b> What if I don't want to study? </b> Your loss. Less studying = lower chances of getting a medal. </p>
  <p> <b> How much of a time commitment is this? </b> As much of one as you want it to be. If you would like to study it intensely, study it intensely. If you aren't very very interested, then don't. 
  <p> <b> How big a deal is an exam perfect score? </b> Are you kidding me? Nobody gets a perfect score. The top score in the middle school section in 2016 was a 39/50. At the high school level, the high score was a 47. Perfect scores are basically impossible, so don't feel bad if you miss 20 or more. The gold medal cutoff for Novice in 2016 was 27. So don't feel bad if you do "badly". You didn't. </p>
  <p> <b> Ok, I'm convinced. Are sign-ups closed yet? </b> No, sign-ups are open until February 6th. The test is administered from February 10-March 18. Here is the <a href="https://secure.quia.com/nrceorder">link for registration</a>.

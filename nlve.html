<p>
<b> what is the nlve? </b> 
the national latin vocabulary exam is an online 70-question multiple choice contest. each level takes a different test; the cutoffs vary each year based on average scores.
<p> <b> why should i take it? </b>
if you learn every word on the vocabulary list, you're GUARANTEED a perfect score (for latin 1/2, 1, 2, and 3!). yep, that's what the njcl website says! most optional exams aren't this predictable and this one is a great way to get a gold medal/perfect!
<p> <b> what if i don't want to study? </b>
you definitely don't have to! even without studying, you can still get a high score because you've learned much of this vocab already in latin class! 
<p> <b> how much of a time commitment is this? i don't have that much extra time! </b>
if you choose not to study, only the 20-ish minutes when you take the actual exam. if you do study, im p sure it would take abt 30-60 minutes to memorize every word on the list, depending on your level!
<p> <b> how much of a big deal is a perfect score? </b>
a perfect score is extremely prestigious; you might be the only one out of the â‰ˆ500 students who take the exam. that's a big deal!
<p> <b> ok, i'm convinced! are sign-ups closed yet? </b>
ask mrs. masoni! the registration window closes on february 6, but idk if she's closing signups sooner or she's only taking a set number of students.
<p> <b> is there a way to estimate my score? </b>
yep! take last year's exam; your score will generally be 5-6 points higher!
<p> <b> i just got my estimated/real score back! is it above the gold/silver/bronze cutoff? </b>
i don't know yet! njcl releases the official cutoffs based on the averages every year. generally, though, gold is 48-50, silver is 43-45, and bronze is around 40.

<font size="48px"> national classical etymology exam! </font>
<p> <b> what is the ncee? </b>
the national classical etymology exam is an online 50-question multiple choice contest. each level takes the same exam, but the medal cutoffs vary per level!
<p> <b> why should i take it? </b>
the ncee is one of the hardest contests, but never fear, you can still medal! a gold on this exam is super prestigious. even if you don't medal, the ncee is still a valuable learning experience!
<p> <b> what if i don't want to study? </b>
you don't have to study, but it's definitely recommended. if you don't study at all, you may not medal (depending on your etymology skills). but if you don't have time, that's ok! just take the exam and you have a p good chance of getting a medal!
<p> <b> how much of a time commitment is this? i don't have that much time! </b>
tbh studying for this exam is definitely time-consuming and you're probably not going to be able to learn everything on the <a href= "http://tiny.cc/ncee"> study guide </a> without setting aside a few hours to review. but you really don't have to study (a lot of ppl don't) and you still have a decent chance of doing well!
<p> <b> how much of a deal is a njcl high score? (40+) </b>
like i said, this exam is hard, so a high score is <b>extremely</b> impressive!
<p> <b> ok i'm convinced! are sign-ups closed yet? </b>
sorry, the exam is already over, but you still have next year! this exam is offered at both the middle and high school.
<p> <b> is there a way to estimate my score? </b> 
yep! i averaged about a 37-38 when taking the practice exams (except for a couple of perfect scores, which were flukes) and i ended up getting a 41. if you're freaked out by your "bad" practice test scores, keep in mind that you tend to score 3-7 points higher on the real thing!
<p> <b> i just got my estimated/real score back! is it above the gold/silver/bronze cutoff? </b>
the cutoff depends on the avg scores every year, but it's usually around 32-34 for gold, 29-31 for silver, and 27-28 for bronze!
